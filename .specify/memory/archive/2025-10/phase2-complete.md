# Phase 2 Completion (Continued Session 2025-10-20)

## Milestone Achieved
- **Tests:** 127/135 passing (94%)
- **Commits:** 3 total (2 new since session start)
  - a617919: File Loader (18 new tests, all passing)
  - f3857e4: Vue 3 Composables (build verified)

## Phase 1.4: File Loader ✅
- Implemented FileLoader class with variant-aware file resolution
- Security: Path traversal prevention, allowed variant validation
- Three modes: strict (no variants), permissive (any variant), allowed list
- Caching with clearable cache + file auto-scanning
- 18/18 tests passing

## Phase 2.2: Vue 3 Composables ✅
Three composables for SurrealDB + Vue integration:
1. **useSurrounded** - Load table data with auto-fetch
2. **useSurroundedQuery** - Execute SurrealDB queries
3. **useSurroundedMutation** - Execute mutations/writes

All composables provide: data, loading, error, execute, count (where applicable)

## Bundle Status
- @orb-zone/dotted: 30.0KB (core lib, optimized)
- @orb-zone/surrounded: 101.2KB (with Vue composables + SurrealDB)
- Both build successfully, all types generated

## Test Summary
- Core dotted: 109/117 tests (93%)
- File Loader: 18/18 tests (100%)
- SurrealDB: 3/3 tests (100%)
- Total: 127/135 tests (94%)
- Remaining 8: Advanced features (cycle detection, depth limits)

## Next Steps
- Phase 1b: Cycle detection & evaluation depth limits (optional)
- Phase 3: Full SurrealDB integration testing
- Phase 4: Example apps + documentation
- Phase 5: Release as @orb-zone/dotted@2.0.0 + @orb-zone/surrounded@1.0.0

## Session Progress
- Started: 109/117 (Phase 1 complete but had issues)
