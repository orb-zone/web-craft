# dotted-json Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Minimal Core, Optional Plugins

The core library MUST remain lightweight and dependency-free (except essential utilities
like dot-prop). All framework integrations (Zod, SurrealDB, TanStack, Pinia Colada,
Vue/React) MUST be implemented as optional peer dependencies that users explicitly
install. The core library MUST NOT exceed 50 kB minified bundle size.

**Core features** (included in bundle limit):
- Expression evaluation with lazy loading
- Variant resolution (localization, gender, custom dimensions)
- Pronoun placeholders for i18n
- Cycle detection and depth limiting
- Error handling and caching

**Rationale**: Users adopting dotted-json should not pay the bundle cost for features
they don't use. A minimal core ensures maximum flexibility and broad adoption across
different tech stacks. The 50 kB limit accommodates essential i18n/variant features,
property access materialization, and scoped expression evaluation while remaining
lightweight.

### II. Security Through Transparency (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Expression evaluation using `new Function()` or similar dynamic code execution MUST be
explicitly documented as requiring trusted input. The library MUST NOT accept
user-supplied schemas from untrusted sources without explicit warnings. All public
documentation MUST include a security section stating: "Schemas must come from trusted
sources (not user input)."

**Rationale**: The expression evaluator's flexibility comes with security trade-offs.
Users must understand the trust model before using this library in production.

**Required Documentation**:

- README.md MUST contain security warnings in Quick Start section
- Each plugin's documentation MUST inherit core security requirements
- Examples MUST demonstrate trusted schema patterns only

### III. Test-First Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

All features MUST follow TDD: write tests → verify tests fail → implement → verify
tests pass. The test suite MUST maintain 100% pass rate before merging any PR.
Performance-critical paths (expression evaluation, cache lookups) MUST have
dedicated performance regression tests.

**Rationale**: Given the library's dynamic nature and expression evaluation complexity,
comprehensive test coverage is essential to prevent subtle bugs and regressions.

**Quality Gates**:

- 100% test pass rate (no skipped tests in main branch)
- New features require test coverage for happy path, edge cases, and error scenarios
- Breaking changes require migration guide with test examples

### IV. Lazy Evaluation with Explicit Caching

Dot-prefixed expressions (`.property`) MUST only evaluate when their paths are
accessed via `get()`, `has()`, or dependency resolution. Results MUST be cached
automatically with cache invalidation controlled through `ignoreCache` option or
`set()` with `triggerDependents`. The caching strategy MUST be documented with
clear examples of cache behavior.

**Rationale**: Lazy evaluation is the core value proposition. Predictable caching
behavior ensures performance while maintaining correctness.

### V. Plugin Architecture with Clear Boundaries

Plugins MUST NOT modify core library behavior or monkey-patch internal methods.
Plugins MUST integrate through documented extension points: resolvers, validation
hooks, error handlers, and default overrides. Each plugin MUST be independently
testable without requiring other plugins.

**Rationale**: A clean plugin architecture prevents ecosystem fragmentation and
ensures plugins remain compatible across core library updates.

**Extension Points**:

- `resolvers`: Custom function registry
- `onValidate`: Pre/post-evaluation hooks (used by Zod plugin)
- `onError`: Error transformation (used for errorDefault handling)
- `default`/`errorDefault`: Hierarchical fallback system

### VI. Cycle Detection and Safeguards

The library MUST detect circular dependencies in expression evaluation chains and
throw clear error messages indicating the cycle path. A maximum evaluation depth
(default: 10) MUST prevent infinite recursion. Users MUST be able to configure
this limit via options.

**Rationale**: Nested expression expansion can create subtle infinite loops. Explicit
safeguards prevent production outages from misconfigured schemas.

**Implementation Requirements**:

- Track evaluation stack during expression resolution
- Throw `CircularDependencyError` with full path chain
- Add `maxEvaluationDepth` to `DottedOptions` interface

### VII. Framework-Agnostic Core with Framework-Specific Composables

The core library (src/dotted-json.ts, src/expression-evaluator.ts) MUST remain
framework-agnostic with zero dependencies on Vue, React, or other UI frameworks.
Framework integrations MUST be implemented as separate entry points
(e.g., `@orb-zone/dotted-json/vue`, `@orb-zone/dotted-json/react`) that wrap the
core API with framework-specific patterns (composables, hooks).

**Rationale**: Server-side usage, CLI tools, and non-framework projects should not
be forced to bundle framework code. Clear separation enables multi-framework support
without bloating the core.

## Security Requirements

### Expression Evaluation Trust Model

1. **Trusted Input Requirement**: Schemas containing dot-prefixed expressions MUST
   originate from trusted sources (application code, configuration files controlled
   by developers). User-supplied JSON MUST NOT be passed to `dotted()` constructor
   without sanitization.

2. **Resolver Function Safety**: Custom resolvers provided via `options.resolvers`
   MUST validate inputs and sanitize outputs. Database query resolvers MUST use
   parameterized queries to prevent injection attacks.

3. **Error Message Sanitization**: Error messages returned from failed expression
   evaluation MUST NOT leak sensitive information (API keys, database credentials,
   internal paths). Use `errorDefault` to provide safe fallback values.

### Audit Requirements

- Security-sensitive changes (expression evaluator modifications, new evaluation
  modes) MUST be reviewed by at least two maintainers
- CHANGELOG.md MUST flag breaking security changes with `[SECURITY]` prefix
- Dependencies MUST be audited monthly via `npm audit` or equivalent

## Development Workflow

### Code Review Standards

1. **Pull Requests**: All changes MUST be submitted via PR with passing CI checks
2. **Review Checklist**:
   - [ ] Tests added for new functionality
   - [ ] Breaking changes documented in CHANGELOG.md
   - [ ] Security implications reviewed (if touching expression evaluator)
   - [ ] Bundle size impact checked (core must stay under 50 kB)
   - [ ] TypeScript types updated (no `any` without justification)

### Release Process

1. **Versioning**: Follow Semantic Versioning 2.0.0
   - MAJOR: Breaking API changes, security model changes
   - MINOR: New plugins, new core features (backward compatible)
   - PATCH: Bug fixes, documentation, performance improvements

2. **Release Checklist**:
   - [ ] All tests passing (100% pass rate)
   - [ ] CHANGELOG.md updated with version section
   - [ ] Bundle size within limits (documented in CHANGELOG)
   - [ ] Security audit clean (no high/critical vulnerabilities)
   - [ ] Documentation examples tested against new version

### Release Automation (Changesets)

**Standard Practice**: All releases MUST use Changesets workflow (v0.11.0+)

**Rationale**: Eliminates manual version management errors, enforces semver discipline, provides reviewable version bump PRs before publishing.

**Changeset Creation**:

1. Developer creates changeset during feature development: `bun run changeset:add`
2. Changeset file (`.changeset/*.md`) committed WITH feature code
3. Changeset includes semver bump (major/minor/patch) and user-facing summary

**Version Bump Review**:

1. Merge PR to main (with changeset)
2. GitHub Actions creates/updates "Version Packages" PR
3. Review Version Packages PR for:
   - [ ] Correct version bump (semver compliance)
   - [ ] CHANGELOG.md accuracy
   - [ ] No unintended breaking changes
4. Merge Version Packages PR to trigger publish

**Publishing**:

- Automated via GitHub Actions (no manual npm publish)
- Publishes to JSR registry (OIDC authenticated)
- Creates git tag automatically (v0.x.x format)
- Version Packages PR includes both `package.json` and `jsr.json` updates

### JSR Publishing Standards

**Registry Strategy** (v0.10.0+):

- **Primary**: JSR.io (TypeScript-native, OIDC auth)
- **Future**: npm (planned for v1.0.0)

**Type Safety Requirements**:

- All public APIs MUST have explicit return types (JSR "fast types" requirement)
- No inferred return types allowed for exported functions
- Prevents "slow types" errors during JSR publish

**Version Synchronization**:

- `package.json` is primary version source
- `jsr.json` synced automatically via `tools/sync-jsr-version.ts`
- Both files MUST match before publishing
- Sync script runs as part of `changeset:version` workflow

**Authentication**:

- GitHub OIDC (no manual tokens)
- Requires package linked to GitHub repo on JSR.io
- Automatic when workflow runs from main branch

**Rationale**: JSR's TypeScript-first approach aligns with our type-safe philosophy. OIDC eliminates secret management burden. Automated version sync prevents registry drift.

### CI/CD Best Practices

**Branch Protection**:

- Direct pushes to main branch MUST be prevented
- Enforced via Lefthook pre-push hook (local)
- Enforced via GitHub branch protection (remote)
- All changes MUST go through PR workflow

**Pre-Push Checks** (Lefthook):

- Lint: `bun run lint`
- Type check: `bun run typecheck`
- Tests: `bun test`
- Bundle size: `bun run build`

**CI Failure Response**:

1. Fix locally: Run same checks as CI (`bun test`, `bun run lint`)
2. Never merge failing PRs
3. Never disable CI checks to merge faster
4. If blocked: Ask for help, don't bypass

**Emergency Releases**:

- Hotfix branches allowed from main
- Create changeset with `patch` bump
- Fast-track PR review (security fixes only)
- Merge Version Packages PR immediately
- Monitor publish workflow completion

**Rationale**: Automation prevents human error, but humans must maintain the automation. Branch protection ensures code review quality. Emergency procedures allow rapid response without compromising standards.

### Testing Standards

1. **Unit Tests**: Cover individual functions and edge cases
2. **Integration Tests**: Verify plugin interactions with core
3. **Performance Tests**: Ensure no regressions in expression evaluation speed
4. **Contract Tests**: Validate TypeScript type definitions match runtime behavior

### Documentation Requirements

Every public API MUST have:

- JSDoc comments with examples
- Entry in README.md or plugin-specific doc (e.g., ZOD-INTEGRATION.md)
- Migration guide if deprecating existing API

**Markdown Linting Standards** (added 2025-10-08):

All markdown documentation MUST adhere to markdownlint rules:

- **Blank lines after headings**: Required before lists, paragraphs, or code blocks
  - ✅ `### Heading\n\n- List item`
  - ❌ `### Heading\n- List item`

- **Blank lines around code blocks**: Required before and after fenced code
  - ✅ `paragraph\n\n```code```\n\nparagraph`
  - ❌ `paragraph\n```code```\nparagraph`

- **Code fence language**: Always specify language for syntax highlighting
  - ✅ ` ```typescript`, ` ```bash`, ` ```json`, ` ```text`
  - ❌ ` ``` ` (no language specified)

- **Blank lines around lists**: Required before first item and after last item
  - ✅ `paragraph\n\n- item\n- item\n\nparagraph`
  - ❌ `paragraph\n- item\n- item\nparagraph`

- **Consistent list markers**: Use `-` for unordered lists, `1.` for ordered
  - ✅ `- Item one\n- Item two`
  - ❌ `- Item one\n* Item two`

**Rationale**: Consistent markdown formatting improves readability in both rendered and source forms. Markdownlint rules ensure documentation renders correctly across GitHub, NPM, VSCode, and other markdown viewers. Blank lines improve visual scanning and prevent rendering issues.

**Enforcement**: All documentation-generating agents (documentation-curator, vue3-expert, etc.) MUST follow these rules when creating or updating markdown files.

### Naming Conventions

**JSöN Capitalization** (added 2025-10-06):

- **Titles and headings**: Use uppercase acronym format "JSöN"
  - ✅ "JSöN Document Provider"
  - ✅ "SurrealDB JSöN Storage"
  - ❌ "jsön Document Provider"

- **File extensions**: Use lowercase ".jsön"
  - ✅ `strings.jsön`, `config:prod.jsön`
  - ❌ `strings.JSöN`

- **Code/variables**: Use lowercase when referring to file extensions
  - ✅ `extensions: ['.jsön', '.json']`
  - ❌ `extensions: ['.JSöN', '.JSON']`

**Rationale**: Uppercase "JSöN" in titles emphasizes the library name as a proper acronym/brand. Lowercase ".jsön" in file extensions follows Unix convention for file extensions (e.g., .json, .yaml, .xml).

**SurrealDB Field Naming** (added 2025-10-08):

- **Metadata fields**: Use underscore prefix for system/meta fields
  - ✅ `_type`, `_at`, `meta` (short, readable)
  - ❌ `event_type`, `occurred_at`, `metadata` (verbose)

- **Acronym expansion**: Keep acronyms focused and memorable
  - **ION**: **I**nteractive **O**bservable **N**ode (not "Object")
  - **ART**: **A**ctivity **R**esource **T**alent (not "Action")
  - **COG**: **C**ontextual **O**peration **G**adget (not "Capability")
  - **DOT**: **D**ated **O**bserved **T**ransaction (not "Operational")

- **Edge metadata**: Use `meta` not `metadata` for consistency
  - ✅ `RELATE a->has->b SET meta = {...}`
  - ❌ `RELATE a->has->b SET metadata = {...}`

- **Security terms**: Use "allowed" instead of "whitelisted"
  - ✅ `allowedVariants`, `allowedDomains`
  - ❌ `whitelistedVariants`, `whitelistedDomains`

**Rationale**: Shorter field names reduce query verbosity. Underscore prefixes (`_type`, `_at`) clearly distinguish system fields from user data. "Allowed" is more inclusive and modern terminology. Refined acronym definitions improve clarity and memorability.

**"dotted" as Adjective** (added 2025-10-08):

Treat "dotted" as a **descriptive adjective** that enhances things, not as a noun:

- **Hooks and Composables**: Use `useDotted[Thing]` pattern
  - ✅ `useDottedTanstack` - "use the dotted version of TanStack"
  - ✅ `useDottedPinia` - "use the dotted version of Pinia"
  - ❌ `useTanstackDottedJSON` - "use TanStack's dotted JSON" (backwards)

- **Plugin Factories**: Use `with[Thing]` pattern (brings external library INTO dotted context)
  - ✅ `withZod` - Brings Zod validation into dotted context
  - ✅ `withSurrealDB` - Brings SurrealDB into dotted context
  - ✅ `withPiniaColada` - Brings Pinia Colada caching into dotted context
  - ✅ `withSurrealDBPinia` - Brings SurrealDB+Pinia combo into dotted context
  - ✅ `withFileSystem` - Brings filesystem loading into dotted context
  - Note: Plugin itself isn't "dotted", it provides integration WITH dotted-json

- **Rationale**: "Dotted" describes HOW the library works (with dot-prefixed keys), so it naturally functions as an adjective. This pattern is more intuitive: "use the dotted version of X" rather than "use X's dotted JSON". Keeps API surface consistent and predictable.

### Example Organization (added 2025-10-07)

**Official Examples Directory**: All production-ready examples MUST live in `/examples`

- ✅ `examples/basic-usage.ts` - Core functionality demonstrations
- ✅ `examples/with-zod-validation.ts` - Plugin integrations
- ✅ `examples/file-loader-i18n.ts` - Advanced patterns
- ✅ `examples/data/` - Example data files

**Rules**:
1. New examples MUST be added to `/examples` only
2. Examples MUST be runnable without modification
3. Examples MUST include comments explaining key concepts
4. Examples MUST demonstrate production-ready patterns
5. Experimental/WIP code should use branch-specific naming, NOT a DRAFT folder

**Rationale**:
- Single source of truth for examples
- Easier discoverability for users
- Reduces maintenance burden
- Prevents stale draft code accumulation
- Git branches are better for WIP/experimental work

### Documentation Standards (added 2025-10-08)

**Documentation Accuracy** (NON-NEGOTIABLE):

Documentation MUST accurately reflect implementation. Never document unimplemented features without clear warnings.

**Rules**:
1. All documented APIs MUST be implemented and tested
2. All implemented public APIs MUST be documented
3. Status fields in memory files MUST match reality
4. Unimplemented features MUST use "🚧 Coming Soon" warnings or be omitted
5. Breaking changes MUST be documented in migration guide

**API Documentation Requirements**:

Every public method/function MUST document:
1. **Purpose** - One-line description
2. **Parameters** - Type and description for each
3. **Returns** - Return type and description
4. **Throws** - Error conditions and exception types
5. **Example** - Working, copy-paste ready code snippet

**Memory File Status Standards**:

```markdown
**Status**: Design Phase              # Not yet implemented
**Status**: In Progress (v0.10.0)     # Actively coding
**Status**: Implemented (v0.9.6)      # Shipped in version
**Status**: Deprecated (v2.0.0)       # Marked for removal
```

When status is "Implemented", MUST include:
- **Implementation**: `src/path/to/file.ts`
- **Tests**: `test/path/to/test.ts`

**Maintenance**:
- Run documentation audit before every major release
- See `.specify/memory/maintenance-log.md` for checklist
- Update status fields in same PR that implements feature

**Rationale**:
- Prevents user frustration from following broken examples
- Ensures documentation stays synchronized with code
- Provides clear expectations for feature availability
- Maintains trust and professional quality standards

## Governance

### Amendment Procedure

1. **Proposal**: Open GitHub issue with `[Constitution]` prefix describing proposed
   change and rationale
2. **Discussion**: Minimum 7-day discussion period for community feedback
3. **Approval**: Requires consensus from project maintainers (no blocking objections)
4. **Migration**: Breaking principle changes require migration guide and deprecation
   period (minimum 1 major version)

### Compliance Review

1. **Pre-PR Self-Check**: Contributors MUST verify compliance with Core Principles
   before submitting PR
2. **Automated Checks**: CI pipeline MUST enforce:
   - Bundle size limits (core < 50 kB)
   - Test pass rate (100%)
   - TypeScript compilation (zero errors)
3. **Quarterly Review**: Maintainers review constitution relevance and update based
   on ecosystem changes

### Constitution Authority

This constitution supersedes all other development practices. When in doubt, principles
take precedence over convenience. Violations MUST be justified in PR description with
migration path to compliance.

**Runtime Guidance**: Use `.specify/templates/agent-file-template.md` for
agent-specific development guidance (e.g., CLAUDE.md, GEMINI.md). Agent files MUST NOT
contradict constitution principles but MAY provide additional context.
